abstract = {Ambient occlusion (AO) provides an effective approximation to global illumination that enjoys widespread use amongst practitioners. In this paper, we present a fast easy-to-implement separable approximation to screen space ambient occlusion. Computing occlusion first along a single direction and then transporting this occlusion into a second pass that is stochastically evaluating the final shading based on the AO estimates proves extremely efficient. Combined with interleaved sampling and geometry-aware blur, visually convincing results close to a non-separable occlusion can be obtained at much higher performance.},
